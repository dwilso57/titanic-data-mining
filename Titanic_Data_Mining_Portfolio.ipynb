        "# Titanic Survival Prediction using Data Mining\n",
        "This project uses real Titanic passenger data to predict which passengers were likely to survive. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly data mining project using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.\n",
        "Use machine learning to find patterns in the Titanic dataset and build a simple model that can predict survival based on features like age, gender, and passenger class.\n",

        "- Survival status\n",

        "- Passenger class\n",

        "- Removing missing values\n",
        "- Converting categorical data (like \"sex\") to numeric\n",
        "- Selecting only the most useful features for prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "We use a Decision Tree Classifier from Scikit-learn. This algorithm splits the data into branches based on the most informative questions to predict survival.\n",
        "After training the model and testing it, we achieved an accuracy of about 77%. This means our model predicts survival correctly about 3 out of 4 times.\n",
